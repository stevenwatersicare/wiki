## Ospre 3.0 Rquirements and Enchaments
1. In docspre, it would be nice ot have the ability to move different sections around. For example, doctor's could move the section for adding contacts to the top the page if they prefer to fill out the contact info first. 

2. It would be nice if the schedule and appointment pages looked like an actual calender.

3. The red evenlope section could be enhanced by adding threads and other features that mimic the forum more, so that way we could phase out the forum. 

4. We should use database seeding so patient records are not present in dev and staging enivronments. We should make it so only certain people can open up a record on the live site and see information. Having god like priveledges (even as admin) is not good.
